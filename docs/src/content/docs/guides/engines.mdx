Since pesde runs binary packages using a Luau runtime, we need a way to get one.
pesde 0.6 has introduced a mechanism for this: engines.

An engine is either a Luau runtime or pesde itself. Engines allow your
package to specify what versions it's compatible with.

To specify that your package is compatible with Lune ^0.8.9 and pesde ^0.6.0:

```toml
[engines]
pesde = "^0.6.0"
lune = "^0.8.9"
```

After you add the engines to your manifest run `pesde install` to set up the
necessary files in pesde's bin directory.

<Aside type="note">
	You can also use engines outside projects. They will run the latest version installed locally when
	executed.
</Aside>

The benefit of engines is that users will be immediately warned if they install
a package which uses an incompatible version of a runtime. For example, if we
publish a package with the engines we've written before and a user with
`lune = "=0.9.0"` installs our package they'll get the following message:

```
warn: package acme/bar@0.1.0 lune requires lune ^0.8.9, but 0.9.0 is installed
```
