title: Removing Packages
description: Learn how to remove packages from the registry.

pesde doesn't support removing packages from the registry. This is to ensure
that the registry remains a reliable source of packages for everyone. However,
pesde provides other mechanisms to handle packages that are no longer needed.

## Yanking

Yanking is limited to a specific version (and target) of a package. It is used
to mark a version as broken or deprecated. Yanked versions are unavailable
to download fresh, but they can still be installed if they are present in the
lockfile of a project.

To yank a package, you can use the `pesde yank` command:

```sh
pesde yank <PACKAGE>@<VERSION> <TARGET>
```

You can leave out the target if you want to yank all targets of the version:

```sh
pesde yank <PACKAGE>@<VERSION>
```

## Deprecating

On the other hand, deprecating a package is used to mark a package as deprecated
in the registry. This is useful when you want to discourage users from using
a package, but don't want to break existing projects that depend on it. Unlike
yanking, your package will still be able to be installed fresh. However, when it
is installed, a warning will be shown to the user.

To deprecate a package, you can use the `pesde deprecate` command:

```sh
pesde deprecate <PACKAGE> [REASON]
```

You must provide a non-empty reason when deprecating a package. This is to
inform users why the package is deprecated. For example, if your package
has been replaced by another package, you can provide a reason like:

```sh
pesde deprecate acme/old-package "This package has been replaced by acme/new-package."
```

## Other Options

There are other situations in which you might want to remove a package from
the registry. Please refer to the policies of the registry you are using for
more information on how to handle these situations. The process for the official
registry is described [here](/registry/policies/#package-removal).
