A **binary package** is a package that contains a binary export.

Binary packages can be run like a normal program. There are several ways to use
binary packages with pesde.

## Using a binary package

### With `pesde x`

The `pesde x` command can be used to run a one-off binary package. This is
useful for running a binary package without installing it or outside of a pesde
project.

```sh
pesde x pesde/hello
# Hello, pesde! (pesde/hello@1.0.0, lune)
```

### By installing

Binary packages can be installed using the `pesde add` and `pesde install`
commands.

This requires a `pesde.toml` file to be present in the current directory, and
will add the binary package to the `dependencies` section of the file.

```sh
pesde add pesde/hello
pesde install
```

This will add the binary package to your `PATH`, meaning that it can be run
anywhere in a project which has it installed under that alias!

```sh
hello
# Hello, pesde! (pesde/hello@1.0.0, lune)
```

Note that they are scoped to the nearest `pesde.toml` file. However, you can use
binaries of the workspace root from member packages.

## Making a binary package

To make a binary package you must use a target compatible with binary exports.
These currently are `lune` and `luau`.

Here is an example of a binary package:

```toml title="pesde.toml"
name = "pesde/hello"
version = "1.0.0"
license = "MIT"

[target]
environment = "lune"
bin = "main.luau"
```

The `bin` field specifies the entry point for the binary package. This file
will be run when the binary package is executed.

```luau title="main.luau"
print("Hello, pesde!")
```

Binary packages get access to custom variables provided by pesde. You can find
them in the `_G` table. These are:

- `PESDE_ROOT`: The root (where the pesde.toml is located) of where the package is
  installed. This will be in a temporary directory if the package is run with
  `pesde x`.
